#   c = xcorrf2(a,b)
#    Two-dimensional cross-correlation using Fourier transforms.
#        XCORRF2(A,B) computes the crosscorrelation of matrices A and B.
#        XCORRF2(A) is the autocorrelation function.
#        This routine is functionally equivalent to xcorr2 but usually faster.
#        See also XCORR2.
