# Julia Particle Image Velocimetry

Welcome to the CEOAS Coastal Imaging Lab's RGB video PIV arm of the ROXSI processing pipeline! In this repository you can find a variety of directories related to PIV. This particular project was initiated by Prof. Wilson's desire to move over to an open-source programming platform for data processing. Julia checks all the boxes with a strong scientific programming community, JIT compilation leading to reasonably fast execution, voluntary type safety, and smooth read/write-ability.

The original PIV software, written in Matlab can be learned more about in the .pdf in the root directory of this repo.
